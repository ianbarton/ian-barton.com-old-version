I have been wondering for a while how to produce filtered category lists of
posts in Jekyll. For example I wanted to produce a list of blog posts
that also have the "mountaineering" category. Here is one way of doing
it:


{% for post in site.categories.blog %}
  {% if post.categories contains 'mountaineering' %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> - {{ post.title }}</li>

  {% endif %}

{% endfor %}


In a nutshell the main for loop iterates through all posts with
category "blog" and inside the loop I examine each post to see if it
has the category "mountaineering".
