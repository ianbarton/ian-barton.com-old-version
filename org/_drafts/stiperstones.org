The Stiperstones in Shropshire is a distinctive hill which has
quartzite outcrops or tors along its summit ridge. The summit is very
accessible, with a car park only about 15 minutes walk away. Natural
England and the Shropshire Wildlife Trust has recently begun a "Back
to Purple" project, which aims to remove the conifers and other
woodland and restore the land to heather based heath.
