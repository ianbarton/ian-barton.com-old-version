I have traversed the Glyders a few times starting at Ogwen
and descending to into Capel Curig. Back in 1980 I started in Nant
Peris and did the traverse to Capel Curig. However, this year we were
staying at the Bryn Tyrch in Capel Curig and I decided to do the walk
the opposite way round, from Capel Curig to Nant Peris.
