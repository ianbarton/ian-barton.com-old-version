I had forgotten what a long haul it is to drive via Welshpool to Dinas
Mawddwy.  I got to the small car park at the end of Cwm Cywarch about
5:30pm. Although the car park was nowhere near full, there were more
cars than I had seen on my previous visits. Various people were
returning from their day out and getting ready to depart for home. I
finished packing my rucksack and attached Dad's old Velbon tripod to
the outside. I had also brought along the intervalometer with the
intention of taking some night time sky photographs from the summit.


I set off along the track and ended up outside the Ibex hut. There were
a couple of people sitting outside and I asked if the track behind the
hut continued up to the ????. They didn't know and I don't remember
passing the hut on my previous visits, so I guessed I had missed the
start of the path. I continued along a feint path behind the hut for
some way until it became obvious that I was way off route. I returned
back to the track where the the style I should have climbed over was now obvious!

It was very hot with hardly a cloud in the sky. Luckily after a few
hundred feet most of the steep section of the route was in shade. I
plodded up the path towards the col. Some way below it I came out of
the shade. The sun was low in the sky and shining almost directly in
my face. Even wearing sun glasses it was difficult to see where I was
going. In finally emerged at the col below Glasgwm drenched with
sweat.

The way to the summit was straightforward, albeit a bit of a slog. It
was just a matter of following the fence which leads to within a few
yards of the summit cairn. Once I had emerged from Cwm Cywarch there
were fine views to the West with very little heat haze. I could see the summit of
Arenig Fawr, where I had been a couple of weeks ago, although Moel
Llyfnant, where I had camped was hidden from sight. A final steep rise
bought the summit cairn into view. Llyn Bach just below was almost
dry. I continued past the summit and climbed the stile at the end of
Llyn y Fign. I made my way to the flat grassy area just to the north
of the lake. There was a pleasant westerly breeze which soon
evaporated all the sweat.

I soon had the tent pitched and there was still a couple of hours until
sunset at around 8:45pm, I made a cup of hot chocolate and had some
porridge and raisins. I grabbed the camera and began walking around
the summit plateau. Looking towards Cader I could see how I could take
a high level route and continue over its summit to Dolgelleau. Over to
the South West I could see the wind turbines on ???.  As the sun sank
towards the horizon a layer of cloud formed, so I didn't get the
spectacular sunset that I saw last time. However, the top of Aran
Fawddwy glowed pink as did the summit cairn of Glasgwm.

At this time of year it takes a long time for it to get really dark
after the sun has set, so I got into my sleeping bag for a couple of
hours. I woke up about 12:30am to see a clear sky outside. The stars
of the plough were clearly visible over the top of my tent. I put the
camera on the tripod and started taking some photographs. However, my
attempt was thwarted by condensation forming on the lens. Not even
leaving the camera for some time to adjust to the temperature outside
the tent made any difference. Eventually I called it a night and went
back to my sleeping bag. I woke again at 5:30am and made breakfast -
porridge again! I got out of the tent and began to take
photographs. However, soon a layer of early morning cloud obscured the
summit. I packed up and began the descent back to the car. I dropped
out of the mist, but most of the surrounding summits were misted
out. I had badly bruised my left big toe on my Carneddau trip a few
weeks ago, so the descent was quite slow. Although it had stopped
hurting the nail had turned black and I didn't want to aggravate the
injury.

I drove back along the Cwm following the farmer with his sheep
trailer. The road is very narrow with few passing places, so it was
good to have an oncoming traffic detector in front of me.

On my down the A470 I was delayed some time while the police cleared
away an accident. It looked as though a car had emerged from a side
road and collided with an oncoming car. Although the cars looked a
mess it didn't appear that anyone had been seriously hurt.
