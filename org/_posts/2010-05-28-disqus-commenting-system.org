Comments are a useful part of blogging. However, they are a real
honeypot for spammers. On systems I have used in the past, I got tired
of fighting the spammers and simply turned comments off. However,
have decided to try out a new system powered by [[http://disqus.com][Disqus]] . It isn't
available on all pages, but I'll see how we go.
