This page is a mish mash of short reviews and a list of things I would
like to read. Note I interpret the term "book" very loosely, I include
eBooks and audio books in my definition. In recent years I have taken
to reading a lot of eBooks. I almost always have my phone with me and
I can potentially fit hundreds of books on my SD card. If I have a
couple of minutes to spare I can just whip out the phone and read a
book.

I buy most of my eBooks from [[%5B%5Bhttp://www.fictionwise.com][Fictionwise]]. At one time I bought books
from [[http://www.ereader.com][eReader]], as they often had titles not available at
Fictionwise. Unfortunately, eReader don't look as they are ever going
to get around to releasing a reader for the S60 series 3
phone. Nowadays if I have to buy and encrypted book, I get it in
[[http://www.mobipocket.com][Mobipocket]] format, since their reader is available for most platforms
and seems to be in active development. I also have [[http://www.isilo.com][iSilo]] on my phone
now that they have finally released a version for my phone. Not only
is it a very good reader, but there is a free cross platform
convertor. Amongst other things this does a very good job of
converting web pages into eBook format.

I have a large stack of audio books that I listen to on my Archos
player. I have experimented with a couple of download sites like
[[http://www.spokennetwork.co.uk][Spoken Network]] . However, almost all
of their content is DRM'ed. The additional hassle of removing the DRM,
so I can listen to my purchase in a way that I choose is greater than
the small additional cost of buying the title on CD and then ripping
it into mp3 format.

Quite a lot of the stuff on my Archos originates from Radio 4 or
BBC7. The Beeb are to be applauded for making most of their content
available for listening for seven days after broadcast. For various
copyright reasons they make it difficult for you to record things from
their Listen Again site. If you want to know how I record things to
listen to on my Archos, click [[Linux/HomePage#listenagain | here]] .
