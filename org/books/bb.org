B.B. (Denys Watkins-Pitchford) was born in 1905 and grew up in
Northamptonshire. Poor health prevented him being sent to boarding
school and he spent many hours out in the countryside.

He studied art in Paris and at The Royal College of Art in London. For
seventeen years he taught art at Rugby school. In addition to his
books, he made regular contributions to The Field, Country Life and
Shooting Times. His background in art enabled him to illustrate his
books with evocative scraper board pictures. He died in 1990.

"Tides Ending" describes B.B.’s experiences wild-fowling. The book
captures the atmosphere of the salt marshes. From the Introduction:

"I have wanted to write this book for years because it deals with a
subject which is very dear to me - wildfowl and wild-fowling. I can
say without hesitation that some of the happiest times of my life have
been spent on the saltings and by the estuaries, sometimes with the
gun and glasses, sometimes with glasses alone."

B.B.’s books have been reprinted several times and copies can often be
found in second hand bookshops specializing in the countryside. Other
B.B. books which I have enjoyed reading are "The Shooting Man’s Bedside
Book" and "Quiet Fields".
