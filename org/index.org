Welcome to Ian Barton's web site. You will find a collection of
ramblings about mountaineering, Linux and free software, farming and
the English country side, plus a few other bits and bobs.

After several years using the excellent
[[http://www.pmwiki.org][PmWiki]] wiki based system, I have moved to
using a static site generated with [[http://github.com/mreid/jekyll/][Jekyll]]. Since the site is
maintained just by myself, I didn't really need the collaborative
features of a wiki. Also Jekyll makes it easy for me to write using
Emacs while maintaining my site under version control using Git. I was
also fed up of my web logs filling up wit bots trying to post stuff to
my wiki, even though all edits required authorization. In fact the
bots were using up almost all the RAM on my Xen virtual web server and
I got tired of adding the bot ip addresses to my hosts.deny.

It's going to take a while to get this site working properly. If you
find any broken links, or missing pages, please let me know.
