This page is about some of my mountaineering equipment. I'll attempt to
explain why I chose it and hope that the information will help you
choose your own gear.
* Rucksacks.
Sometime in the late 1970's or early 1980's I bought a Karrimor
Alpiniste. I didn't get the very original version, with the zip all
the way up the middle, but the version after that. In those days it
came with a lifetime guarantee. If you managed to break it, Karrimor
would fix it. I managed to wear a hole in the base and some other
minor problem, which Karrimor fixed without a quibble. Until last year
(2009), I have continued to use this sack. However, it was very
battered and I felt that after 30 years it was time for a new sack!

I have some very simple, but specific requirements for a rucsack:

- It must be single compartment - I really don't like dual compartment sacs.

- No outside pockets, or if they exist they must be easily removable.

- Slim profile, so it doesn't get jammed in chimneys, etc.

- Size around 50 litres.

- Able to withstand being bashed about on climbs.

** POD Black Ice Rucsack.

This seems a fairly simple list of requirements. However, it seems
almost impossible to buy a single compartment sac of around 50 litres
without lots of permanently attached bits and pieces.

Finally I stumbled across an article about POD sacks. POD (Pete
O'Donovan) started out making chalk bags in his house in Sheffield. He
went on to make one of the first tear drop rucksacks, which had a
zipped top. He has now sold the company, but the current owners still
use him as a consultant. More importantly they produce a range of
rucksacks, primarily aimed at alpinists, but which had all the
features I wanted. They are not cheap, so I definitely wanted to see
one and try it out before buying it. Luckily a short holiday in
Keswick gave me the chance to try one out. It turned out that
[[http://www.needlesports.com/][Needlesports]] in Keswick stock the POD range of sacs. I was fairly
certain that I wanted the [[http://www.needlesports.com/acatalog/Mail_Order_POD_56.html][Black Ice]] . You can remove the waist belt if
required and the hood is extensible to enable you to increase its
capacity. 

The sac's capacity is 50 litres with an extra 10 litres if
you extend the hood. For most of the time 50 litres is quite enough,
but with three children's gear to carry, the ability to increase the
capacity was welcome.

I spent about half an hour in the shop trying the sac out, filled with
varying numbers of ropes to check how it performed when carrying
different weights. I was convinced that the Black Ice was even better
than my old Karrimor Alpiniste and I ended up buying it.
* Stoves and Cooking.
Over the years I have owned many different stoves. I started out with
an army hexamine burner, which I used in the 1976 on a trip to
Scandanavia. In the 1980's I bought one of the original MSR multi-fuel
stoves on a trip to Canada. This stove lasted until a few years
ago. While it would burn almost any fuel, priming it was a chore and
from time to time I had to unblock the jet. I have now
settled on two stoves that I use regularly:

** Primus Gravity Stove.
I bought this stove from [[http://www.rvops.co.uk/primus-gravity-gas-stove-ii-ef-1331.html][RvOps]] . It uses resealable gas canisters,
which are attached to the stove by a length of flexible pipe. Together
with a pre-heater this allows the stove to be used in very cold
conditions by inverting the gas canister. I managed to use it on a
recent trip when it was about -4C.

</div>

The legs fold in, making the stove compact to carry. Since the
canister is separate to the stove, it has a low centre of gravity,
which makes it harder to spill things! Included with the stove are a
heat reflector and windshield. There is also a Piezo igniter, although
I always carry a TurboFlame lighter too.

When packed down the whole stove will fir inside my cook set. There
are smaller and lighter stoves, but I like the flexibility of having
the gas canister not attached directly to the stove.

** Trangia Meths Stove.
I have used Trangia's for many years. The stove comes with its own
integrated cook set. Unlike most stoves, it actually works better if
there is a breeze. I prefer it to a gas stove if I am actually cooking
something, rather than just heating something up.

  <p>Trangia Stove.</p>
</div>
#+END_HTML

Its only disadvantages are slow time to boil water and in some places
meths can be hard to obtain.

** Cooking Sets.
If I am using the Trangia, I don't need to take a separate set, as
it's already part of the stove. For many years I have had an aluminium
set, which I used with gas stoves. However, last year I saw an [[http://www.outdoorsmagic.com/reviews/cooking-eating-and-drinking/pans/msr-alpine-cookset/213.html][MSR
Alpine Cookset]] in a sale at Field and Trek. This is quite a bit
lighter than my aluminium set, but you have to be careful not to burn
things as the pans are very thin. Note that unlike older sets the
newer MSR sets do not have a raised section in the centre of the pan,
which caused uneven heating.

If you have to pay full price (around Â£35) probably not worth it. Look
out for them in a sale.

* Sleeping.
** Thermarest Neoair Sleeping Mat.
I still have my original Karrimor yellow mat, which I bought in the
1970's. Since then I have bought one of the Thermarest self inflatable
mats, which I use when we go car camping. However, this is too bulky
to carry on a rucksack. Now I am getting older the old yellow Karrimat
seems to be getting more uncomfortable, so I wanted something lighter
than my current Thermarest, but more comfortable than my Karrimat!

  <p>Neoair.</p>
</div>
#+END_HTML


A year or so ago Thermarest announced a new type of mat called the
[[http://www.facewest.co.uk/Thermarest-Neoair.html][Neoair]] . This is a sort of super sophisticated lilo - you have to
inflate it. However, it's much more technical than the classic
lilo. An internal reflective layer provides heat insulation from the
ground and an internal baffle arrangement provides stability and
comfort.

I was initially dubious, partly because of reports of problems with
some early mats not remaining inflated. Apparently this was caused by a
packing problem in early batches and has now been resolved. I recently
decided to buy one to use when I am backpacking.

The mat packs down to the size of a one litre bottle and weighs about
260g. I bought the regular size (72"), rather than the small (42"), as
I didn't want my legs dangling off the end.

I used it on my recent overnight trip on Moel Siabod. It was very
comfortable, much more so than the standard Thermarest. Even though
the outside temperature fell to -4C I didn't feel cold. In fact it was
so comfortable that I am giving my original Thermarest to one of the
children and I'll use the Neoair when we go car camping. The Neoair
does feel somewhat fragile and it remains to be seen how well it
performs long term.


** Sleeping Bags.
My first sleeping bag was a Blacks Good Companion. This had a feather
(not down) filling, weighed a ton and wasn't all that warm. I have
memories of one New Year at Wasdale Head. It was sometime in the late
1970's and there was record snowfall and low temperatures. I was
extremely cold, even when wearing all my clothes inside the bag. I
remember we used to go to the toilets at frequent intervals, to warm
our hands under the dryer.

After that trip I bought a Mountain Equipment Redline. This was filled
with down and even at that time was expensive. However, it was a good
investment, as I still have it. During that time it has been back to
Rab a couple of times to be cleaned and to have a bit more down blown
into it. Its disadvantages are that it is far too hot in Summer and as
the outer isn't waterproof the down tends to get damp in UK conditions.

I have also had a couple of Mountain Equipment synthetic fill bags,
which I used in summer. My current bag is a Mountain Equipment
Dragon. However, it's now at least 10 years old and isn't really warm
enough except on warm summer nights.

I am planning to buy a [[http://www.webtogs.co.uk/Rab_Alpine_400_Sleeping_Bag_102056.html][Rab Alpine 400]] . This is filled with down and
has a Pertex Quantum outer, which is almost completely waterproof and
I hope will overcome the problem of the down getting damp. It may turn
out to be too warm in summer, but if that's the case I can carry on
using my old synthetic fill bag.

* Tents.
My first tent was a Robert Saunders Base Camp, which I took with a
friend on a three week trip to Scandanavia in 1976. This was a great
tent, but heavy to carry.

I subsequently bought a Vango Force 10, with a nylon flysheet. This
was great for car camping, but too heavy to carry. I lent it to
someone who never returned it. It's probably still going strong.

In the mid 1980's I bought a Wild Country Quasar. This was probably
the best tent I have ever owned. It's was amongst the first  Geodesic
dome designs. It was incredibly stable and had plenty of room for
two. It was a bit too heavy for backpacking, but that wasn't what I
used it for. I worked out that I had spent more than a year sleeping
in it. It had been on a couple of trips where it had been exposed to
high levels of UV, so eventually the fabric go so weak it simply tore.

A few years ago I bought a [[http://www.outdoorsmagic.com/reviews/tents/two-person/vango-tbs-micro-200-tent/3622.html][Vango]] TBS Micro 200. Now that I have three
children, spending nearly Â£400 to replace the Quasar on a tent just
for me was out of the question. The TBS Micro pitches all in one,
which stops the inner getting wet in bad weather. Overall it has been
a good tent. My only gripe is that it is a bit too small for me. At
6ft 2" I can't stretch out fully without touching the ends and I can't sit
upright in the middle of the tent. It has performed well in some fairly wet
and windy weather and I am keeping it if the children want to sleep in
their own tent (we also have a big Outwell family tent).

At the end of last year I bought a Vango [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vango-Spectre-Tent-Updated-2010/dp/B002ZDOIOY][Spectre 200]] . This is also a
2 person tent, but larger than the TBS Micro, although it weighs
slightly less.It uses the same internal Tension Band System (TBS),
which means that it stable in bad weather. There isn't a porch, so you
have to cook under the open side door in bad weather. There are zips
at either end of the inner, which give access to the small space under
the flysheet. I tend to use my rucksack as a pillow on short trips, so
don't need to keep it outside. It weighs about 2.75kg and pitches as
one with the flysheet. The couple of times that I have used it so far,
I have been very pleased with it. Apparently it's D of E (Duke of
Edinburgh Scheme) approved, so if any of the children decide to enter
the D of E scheme, they can use it for that.

** Bivvy and Bothy Bags.
My first bivvy bag was one of those orange plastic sacks that you can
buy from any outdoor shop. Apart from using it to sit on, I don't
remember ever using it to sleep in. That was probably a good thing, as
I would ended up getting soaking wet from condensation even if it
didn't rain.

Sometime in the 1980's I bought a Wild Country Goretex bivvy bag. I
don't know the exact model, but it has almost a full length zip and a
large cowl. The full length zip means it is easy to get into,
particularly if you are sitting on a ledge half way up a mountain. The
cowl is large enough to store some gear and clothing if you are lying
flat. If you are sat on a ledge in a snowstorm, it stops the snow
drifting inside the bag.

I have used this bag extensively in the past for everything from
sleeping in South Stack car park at Gogarth, to alpine bivvies. Even
after more than 25 years it is still in good condition.

Now that I have three children, I wanted some sort of emergency
shelter that would fit up to five of us. Looking around various
outdoor websites, I learnt about Bothy Bags. I ended up buying a Terra
Nova bag and you can't read my post about it
[[http://www.ian-barton.com/2010/01/21/bothy-bag.html][here]] .

* Clothing.
** Trousers.
When I first started walking I bought a pair of Blacks Tweed breeches
after several episodes of walking in wet jeans. I still have the breeches  and
they still fit me nearly 30 years later, although I no longer wear them!

At some point I bought a pair of Rohan Super Striders, which served me
well for many years. As I became more interested in Winter climbing, I
bought a pair of Rohan Super Salopettes. There is a photo of me on the
kitchen wall wearing them in the Albert Premier hut in 1985. I
actually wore these about 2 years ago (2008) on a North Wales Winter
climb. Apart from the elastic shoulder straps perishing they were
still fine. You can read about the history of Rohan [[http://rohantime.com/][here]] . There is a
contribution from Sarah Howcroft the wife of Rohan's founder
Paul. Although Rohan have been taken over and gone on to be a high
street brand, in the beginning they were ahead of their time. I can
remember visiting their shop in Long Preston on the way back to
Sheffield from the Lakes. You can see a time line of their products
[[http://homepage.mac.com/inov8/Compass/rohanhistory.html][here]] , which shows how many modern ideas were first seen in Rohan
gear.

In the early 1990's I was lucky enough to be given a set of Buffalo
gear by the proprietor Hamish Hamilton. For cold conditions,
especially Scottish Winters, where conditons vary between rain and
being blasted with powder snow in the same day, Buffalo is undoubtedly
the best thing I have ever owned. On a Scottish winter route I would
normally wear just the Mountain Shirt and salopettes. I have never felt
cold in Buffalo gear and even though the gear itself gets wet, your
skin is always kept dry by the wicking action. However, once the
temperature gets above freezing I soon start to overheat in Buffalo
clothing, even with all the venting zips open.

For every day use and walking in most seasons apart from winter, I
tend to use Craghopper Kiwis. If you shop around you can buy them for
about Â£25. They are quite windproof and dry very quickly when
wet. However, they also get wet very easily. Brush against a bit of
wet bracken and you will be soaked.

A few months ago I started researching the "perfect" mountain
trousers. After researching for quite a while I decided on the Mammut
Base Jump pants. Unfortunately, Mammut decided to refresh their range
at this time and no one had any in stock in my size. When the new Base
Jump range arrived, it was quite a bit more expensive than the already
very expensive old range. However, this meant the Mammut Champ pants,
which are the more expensive version of the Base Jump were now cheaper
than the new Base Jumps.

I was very dubious about paying Â£116 for a pair of trousers, but
eventually talked myself into it. As my wife will confirm, I almost
never buy clothes, so I didn't feel too bad about spending the money.

I have now had them a couple of months and am very happy with
them. They are very windproof and while the Schoeller fabric isn't
completely water proof, in anything short of a torrential downpour
water just beads up and runs off. Even though I have some waterproof
over-trousers, I never wear them, so at least I should stay drier in
the long run. The knees are articulated, which is good for scrambling
and climbing. There is also a vent at bottom of the legs which allows
the pants to be worn over climbing or skiing boots.

Unlike some trousers there are no vents. However, even though I tend
to run hot when walking, my legs have never sweated while wearing
them. I think that they are probably too warm for summer (if we have
one). However, I still have my Craghopper Kiwis for warm weather.

** Mid Layer.

*** Paramo.
As part of a clothing "refresh", having bought almost no new walking
gear for about 10 years I decided to investigate the Paramo system
after hearing good things about them.

Initially I wanted something to replace several threadbare fleece
smocks. I ended up buying two Paramo smocks:

**** Paramo Explorer Pull on.

Made from Parameta and quite loose fitting, so will fit over other
garments, such as a shirt. The pull on is reversible with the smooth
side designed to be warn on the outside in warm weather and on the
inside in cooler weather. It has a large zipped pocket, which is
accessible whichever way round you wear the top and press studded
elasticated cuffs, so you can roll the sleeves up.

**** Paramo Mountain Vent.
This is very similar to the Explorer Pull on, but with a much tighter
fit and designed to be worn next to the skin. There are also underarm
vents. I have found this to be a good choice for cycling. I can
regulate my heat using the vents and the wicking characteristics mean
I don't sweat nearly as much as with a conventional micro-fleece.

**** Paramo Torres Gilet.
You either get gilets, or you don't. I find they are great for cold
windy conditions when I am active, but would be too hot in a
jacket. This covers a surprising amount of the time I am outdoors. I
have a couple of gilets, which I warm around the farm almost all the
time, except in summer.

I now wear my Torres Gilet most of the time. The material is pretty
waterproof, although since it doesn't have arms it won't stop you
getting wet if the rain is heavy. It can pack down in its own chest
pocket. There are a couple of hand warmer pockets which zip down to
prevent the material from unsightly bulges. However, if you use the
hand warmer pockets to store things make sure you zip them up, or
things are likely to fall out.

I have worn my Mountain Vent and Torres Gilet on a walk in Wales when
the temperature was below freezing and there was a breeze without
needing to put on another layer.

My only reservation about the Mountain Vent and Explorer Pull On is
whether they are worth the price difference compared to a micro-fleece.

** Outer Layer.
**** Rab Generator Jacket.
I bought this on impulse in a sale in Joe Brown's and I am really glad
I did. 

The Generator has a Pertex Quantum inner and outer filled with
Primaloft 1 fill. Primaloft is a man made fibre, similar to
down. However, unlike down it doesn't transform itself into a soggy
lump when it gets damp. The smock weighs around 330 grammes and packs
up into its own chest pocket, so I am happy to carry it with me all
the time.

In use it's very warm and windproof. While it's not totally
waterproof, it does keep out the misty damp stuff that's so common in
Britain. A nice additional feature is it feels lovely warm and
soft. There is a central zipped chest pocket, big enough to take a map
and a pair of hand warming pockets on either side.


**** Berghaus Goretex Jacket.
I have only ever owned two Gortex jackets. The first was a cagoule. I
can't remember the maker, but it might have been Berghaus. The Goretex
membrane was sandwiched between a heavy Cordura fabric. It was a bit
on the bulky side, but fantastically windproof and very waterproof. It
lasted about 10 years before de-laminating. I was sorry to see it go.

Just at the point when this happened I was lucky enough to be given a
Berghaus Goretex jacket by High Magazine. It doesn't say what model it
is on the jacket, but it has lots of pockets and a nice big adjustable
hood. To be quite honest I don't use it that often. In winter I stick
to my Buffalo gear and don't need a Goretex jacket. I have got past
the stage of wanting to go out whatever the conditions, like I did
when I was younger. So apart from unexpected rain it doesn't get much
use. In future I shall probably stick to my Rab Generator, which is
probably just about as waterproof, much warmer and a lot lighter.

** Hats and Neck Warmers.
I have still got my original wool Blacks balaclava, which I bought in
the 1970's. It's still as itchy now as it was then, so I don't wear it
anymore. My next bit of headgear was a Mountain Equipment fleecy
balaclava. They used to make these out of offcuts from their other
garments and if you lived near Glossop you could pop in and pick one
up very cheaply. I still wear this - I probably bought it in the early 1980's.

I have very recently bought a Paramo [[http://www.whalleyoutdoor.co.uk/shop/product.php?xProd%3D48&xSec%3D9][baseball cap]] . Apart from making me look
even more of a Wally than usual, the peak keeps the sun and rain out
of my eyes. It is very waterproof and I can arrange the neck flap so
the water runs down my outer layer, rather than down my neck. The neck
flap can be folded inside for summer use, or left extended to prevent
your neck getting sunburned.


**** Buff.
The [[http://www.buffwear.co.uk/][Buff]] is something that I would never have bought for myself,
luckily someone gave it to me. Having got it I wonder how  managed
without one. Great for keeping your neck warm, converting into a sun
hat to stop your head getting burnt, turn it into a balaclava, uses
only limited by your [[http://www.buffwear.co.uk/pages/product-info/ways-to-wear.php][imagination]] .

The only downside is that they are quite expensive for what is simply
a fabric tube. However, mine has lasted around 10 years so far. I
presume that you can buy cheaper clone products.

** Gloves.
Most of the time I wear some cheap Thinsulate gloves. I may need to buy a new
pair, as the mice have chewed the fingers out. I still have and use a
couple of pairs of Dachstein mitts. These are fantastic as they stay
warm even when you get them full of snow.

In the 1980's I succumbed to the Gortex glove fashion. Unfortunately,
I dropped one of them on an ascent of Western Gully on Black Ladders
in North Wales. Luckily a few weeks later I found another Goretex
glove somewhere else. Even more luckily it was the same hand as the
one I had lost. The only problem is that it was a different colour to
my original glove, so now I have a pair of gloves of different
colours. Although they are quite good, they don't keep your hands as
warm as Dachsteins once the pile inside gets wet from spindrift.

A couple of years a go my wife bought me a new pair of "modern" winter
climbing gloves. These are supposed to be large size. They fit, albeit
tightly, when my hands are warm. Now I have very slim fingers, but
when my hands get cold and swell slightly I can hardly get the new
gloves on. So I stick with the oddbin Goretex and my original
Dachsteins!
