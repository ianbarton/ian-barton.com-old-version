* What's In My Rucksack.

On my recent two trip over the Carneddau, I was really struggling
carrying my rucksack up the initial steep East ridge of Pen yr Ole
Wen. I thought that I had packed carefully and not brought anything I
didn't need. When I got back home, I decided to weigh everything and
review what I had taken to see what I could cut down on.

There are three lists:

- Tent and rucksack.
- Non food contents of my rucksack.
- Food and water.

** Trying to Make It Lighter!
- Tent: the Vango is a good tent for the price, but quite heavy. I
  could have easily saved more than 1kg by taking my Terra Nova Laser.
- Mug: it's an insulated one and quite heavy. However, it's good for
  keeping drinks hot and I hate trying to drink out of metal mugs.
- Towel: for a single night I could easily have left this out.
- Dehydrated food: I only needed two meals, so I shouldn't have taken four.
- Water: I was camping near the summit where there was no water
  nearby. I tend to drink quite a lot during the day and needed to
  rehydrate two meals and make a couple of hot drinks. As it turned
  out 2.5l was exactly the right amount.
- Gas: I took a big one, whereas I should have bought a small
  100g canister.
- Bivvy bag: didn't really need this, but thought I might use it as a
  tent footprint. In the event I didn't use it at all.
- Lighter and fire steel: didn't need to take both.
- Clothing: I could have left the Vapour Rise jacket behind. The Fuera
  and Generator smock would be enough in summer weather.
- Rucksack: I could buy a lighter one. However, I use the POD for
  climbing and don't really want/need another sack.
